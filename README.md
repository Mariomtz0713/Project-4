# Project-4
Mario Martinez | Savannah Serrano | Diana Ibarra | Joe Montecinos
- In this challenge our team of 4 developed a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Skills used to complete challenge
- Python
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- MongoDB
- Tableau

## Project Parameters
- Data Model Implementation
    - A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model.
    - The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling.
    - The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or MongoDB.
    - The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.
- Data Model Optimization
    - The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself.
    - Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script.
- GitHub Documentation
    - GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use.
    - The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project.
- Group Presentation
    - All group members speak during the presentation.
    - Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions.
    - The content is relevant to the project.
    - The presentation maintains audience interest.
